Data,Predictor variables,Data processing,"We chose to use bioclimatic predictors from CHELSA since their ÔBioClim+Õ variables are high resolution and include more than the standard bioclimatic variables, 1-19. Individual covariates were then chosen based on whether the CHELSA Bioclim+ predictors were also available for the future scenarios.We extracted data at our occurrence points for the 40 CHELSA Bioclim + variables and removed predictors with greater than 20% NAs: 10 variables for both species: fcf, fgd, gddlgd0,Ê gddlgd10, gddlgd5,Ê gdgfgd0, gdgfgd10, gdgfgd5, lgd, and swe. Predictor variable information can be found at <https://chelsa-climate.org/exchelsa-extended-bioclim/>. The final 36 CHELSA Bioclim+ variables were: bio 1-19, gdd0, gdd10, gdd5, gsl, gsp, gst, kg0-kg5, ngd0, ngd10, ngd5, npp, and scd. For the mid (2041-2070) future predictors, we chose the GFDL-ESM4 Earth System models for the shared socioeconomic pathway SSP585. We chose SSP585 as it represents a worst case scenario that seems increasingly likely in the near future.Ê"
